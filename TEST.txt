To check that the attack works:

uncomment: result = true; at line 315 in monitor main.c

this will bypass the monitor completely and
when the monitor starts up app1 at the end
you should see the binary from app2 get run instead

To check that the monitor works:

comment the line you uncommented

now when app1 is ran again at the end it
will run the prints from the app1 binary
like it should.
