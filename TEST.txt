From the s3k/projects/fs folder.

In the conf.h file to test the three different use cases alter the 

REVOKE_DRIVER_MEM_EMPTY_QUEUE
REVOKE_UNRELATED_MEM
REVOKE_DRIVER_MEM_POPULATED_QUEUE
(USE_SENDRECV - see report)

As usual just run with "make qemu" assuming the disk-image has been made ("make disk-image").
The "REVOKE_DRIVER_MEM_POPULATED_QUEUE" is run from within the driver simply to ensure the queue is populated at the time of the revocation request.

The REVOKE_DRIVER_MEM_EMPTY_QUEUE attempts to revoke a capability involving the driver range with the virtio queue empty.
The REVOKE_UNRELATED_MEM attempts to to revoke a capability involving some other unrealted range.
The REVOKE_DRIVER_MEM_POPULATED_QUEUE attempts to revoke a capability involving the driver range while there are unprocessed entries in the virtio queue.
